The shape of the kernel
=======================

The shape of the kernel is defined by the `kernel
function <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(statistics)>`__. The
shape of the kernel determines how the mRNA signal is smoothed.

We adopt the use of the Gaussian kernel due to itâ€™s popular use in
signal processing, however other kernel functions can be used: - we have
had success in using semi-circle kernels when applied to `ISS data of
the human pancreas <https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2020.11.010>`__ -
the `Epanechnikov kernel <https://doi.org/10.1137%2F1114019>`__
minimizes AMISE and has therefore been described as optimal

The following exmaples shows how you can apply a semicircular kernel
instead of a Gaussian.
