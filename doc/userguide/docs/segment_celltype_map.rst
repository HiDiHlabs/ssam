Segmenting the SSAM cell type map
=================================

While we demonstrate the accuracy of SSAM in reconstructing celltype
maps, we understand that many applications in biology require cell
segmentation. As such, the development branch of SSAM supports
segmentation of the celltype map using the ``watershed`` algorithm.

**This is an experimental feature!**

The segmentation of the cell type map can be performed by:

::

   code to run semgnetation

Below we demonstrate the application of the segmentation on the *de
novo* celltype map generated for the mouse SSp osmFISH data.
